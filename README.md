# Impact of Sentiment Analysis in Fake Online Review Detection

![Model Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Sentiment+Impact+Pipeline+Diagram)

This repository implements a sentiment-based machine learning framework to detect fake online hotel reviews. The project investigates the effectiveness of integrating **probabilistic sentiment scores** into the fake review classification pipeline.

---

## üìÑ Overview

- Develop a **custom sentiment model** trained on hotel reviews.
- Analyze how **sentiment score distributions** vary between truthful and deceptive reviews.
- Improve fake review detection by **replacing binary sentiment labels with probabilistic scores**.

---

## üì¶ Dataset

We use the benchmark dataset from [Ott et al. (2013)](http://myleott.com/op-spam.html):

- 800 truthful reviews
- 800 deceptive (fake) reviews  
- Balanced across positive/negative sentiment

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset is not included. Please download it from [here](http://myleott.com/op-spam.html).

## üß™ Key Contributions

- Built a high-accuracy **sentiment classifier** using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.
- Demonstrated **polarization of sentiment** in deceptive reviews.
- Proposed **probabilistic sentiment integration** for improved fake review detection.
